# Final-Project
CM3070: University Final Project - Fake News Detection using Machine Learning and Deep learning techniques

# NoteBooks

Four notebooks used in the final project are available in a folder *Notebooks*. The detail of each notebook is as follows:

*Notebook-1 :* Used for data load, preprocessing, cleaning, data overview, feature extraction and training of traditional machine learning model (Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and KNN)
*Notebook-2 :* Used for the training of LSTM (Multiple Runs performed to get the best parameters) and LSTM-CNN hybrid model. 
*Notebook-3 :* LLM (BERT 1 billion parameters model) zero and few shot classifier testing using limited training.
*Notebook-4 :* LLM Fine-tuning (BERT), fine-tuning of the LLM is performed in this notebook. (Multiple runs are performed to get the best result using a separate notebook unlike LSTM keeping all runs within same notebook).

Models are saved in a folder *Models*
